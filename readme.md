# Application of Neural Networks to Prediction of Vegetation Index #

Sean Thweatt and I are working on a Neural Networks project for Dhruv Batra's
ECE4984 (Machine Learning And Perception) at Virginia Tech, with the
intention of predicting vegetative indices based on historical values,
alongside climate and precipitation data.
